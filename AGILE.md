# Agile Methodoglogy

## Overview

After using [JIRA](https://dnlbowers.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PVS/boards/5/roadmap) for [my last project](https://github.com/dnlbowers/jobs-a-gooden) to track my sprints, I decided to use it again for this project over git hub issues. JIRA has many more build in feature such as the analytics which assist me in the sprint planning and review process.

I split all user stories into several epics and linked each story, task, or bug fix ticket to the related epic. I then toggled the priority to represent must-haves, should-haves, nice to have, etc. Each tickets priority would vary from sprint to sprint in line with an agile methodology ensuring each sprint is focused on the most important tasks required to provide the necessary MVP.

## Sprint Notes

Below is a summary of learnings from each Sprint

### Sprint 1 Notes

The sprints focus was to get the development environment step up and deployed to Heroku to be able to test in production as early as possible.

* Due to the addition of AWS S3 bucket in this project I allowed a little bit longer for sprint than I did for myu previous project The allocated story points for each ticket indicate where I expect to have to spend more time on things due to lack of experience or previous issues when performing this aspect of the initial deployment of a project.
* This sprint began on 18/9/2022 and was due to finish at 21/09/2022.

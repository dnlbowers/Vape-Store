# Agile Methodoglogy

## Overview

After using [JIRA](https://dnlbowers.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PVS/boards/5/roadmap) for [my last project](https://github.com/dnlbowers/jobs-a-gooden) to track my sprints, I decided to use it again for this project over git hub issues. JIRA has many more build in feature such as the analytics which assist me in the sprint planning and review process.

I split all user stories into several epics and linked each story, task, or bug fix ticket to the related epic. I then toggled the priority to represent must-haves, should-haves, nice to have, etc. Each tickets priority would vary from sprint to sprint in line with an agile methodology ensuring each sprint is focused on the most important tasks required to provide the necessary MVP.

## Sprint Notes

Below is a summary of learnings from each Sprint

### Sprint 1 Notes

The sprints focus was to get the development environment step up and deployed to Heroku to be able to test in production as early as possible.

* Due to the addition of AWS S3 bucket in this project I allowed a little bit longer for sprint than I did for myu previous project The allocated story points for each ticket indicate where I expect to have to spend more time on things due to lack of experience or previous issues when performing this aspect of the initial deployment of a project.
* This sprint began on 18/9/2022 at 02:00 and was due to finish at 21/09/2022 by 23:59.
* Finished well ahead of time as I was able to complete all the tasks in less than 24 hours with no major issues. I did however take a little bit longer than 24 hours to document the process in DEPLOYMENT.md and therefore the higher story point values were warranted.

### Sprint 2 Notes

This sprint was aimed at getting the coding side of the project up and running. I have decided to stick with one week sprints as I did with my previous project. The planning aspect of this sprint has probably seen me over estimate the story points however due to the fact that I took a break to focus on my new professional role I wanted to ensure I had enough time to get back into the swing of things.

* This sprint began on 28/09/2022 at 22:00 and was due to finish at 5/10/2022 by 23:30.
* Finished a day late because I took a bit long to arrange the styling as part of PV5-46. There were perhaps some additionally parts to the styling I could have added, however a sprint is supposed to be a set time period which I had breached already and the extra bits were not essential to meet the acceptance criteria or meet the tasks related to the ticket.
* I carried over PV5-10 to the next sprint as I was not able to complete it in time.

### Sprint 3 Notes

This sprint is aimed at getting the products portion of the site up and running, I need to make the models to hold the product/category data, upload some products and then create the views to display the data to the user. This process will include creating the admin page for products so I can manually add them to the site.

* This sprint began on 7/10/2022 at 17:45 and was due to finish at 15/10/2022 by 00:00.
* 55 story points in total organized to be 60% must haves, 20% nice to haves, and 20% should haves.

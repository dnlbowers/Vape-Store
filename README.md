# **Vapor Deli** (review after project and add where needed)

Vapor deli is a fictional B2C vape supply store design and implemented with Django, Python, HTML and CSS. IIt aims to provide and easy to use interface where customers can browse all items at once or sort into specified categories. The site provides search functionality as well as an inbuilt stock system to ensure users cannot buy items which are not currently in stock, and once signed in allows the user to save an address to their profile for easy and convenient checkout.

### ***Site Aims***

These days vaping has become a very popular and wide spread replacement for traditional cigarettes and therefore the possible product categories are vast. For the purpose of this project I will only be focusing on the few categories which are widely considered to be the core products in the vaping scene,  and any customer would expect to find in a store of this type. The exception to this would be sites that specialize in solely the production of e-liquid (e.g. [flavor art](https://flavourart.com/)) or vaping devices (e.g [SmokStore](https://www.smokstore.com/)). Since this site is designed to be the web presence of a physical shop, a variety of products is expect to assist people with their vaping needs.

The minimum must have product categories for a shops in the genre are: -

* Disposable vapes.
* E-liquids.
* DIY liquids section.
* MODS with Variable wattage/voltage, and/or temperature control.
* Tanks and coils.
* Batteries.
* Chargers.

### ***Scope:***

The above represents the bare minimum required for a fully functional E-commerce website. Given the time frame for this project I believe all of it to be achievable however using the agile methodology I will be reviewing my progress weekly and adding, adapting or removing features as applicable to the project at the review portion after each sprint.

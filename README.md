# **Vapor Town**

Vapor Town is a fictional B2C vape supply store designed and implemented with Django, Python, HTML, and CSS. It aims to provide an easy-to-use interface where customers can browse all items at once or sort into specified categories. The site offers search functionality and an inbuilt stock system to ensure users cannot buy things that are not currently in stock. Once signed in, users can save an address to their profile for easy and convenient checkout.

This small-scale business idea was born from a pipe dream back when I used to dream of having an online store selling all the latest and greatest vape gear. This dream has since dissipated, but I decided to use this project to learn and practice my skills in Django and Python.

The deployed site can be visited here: [Vapor Town](https://vaportown.dev-bowers.com/)

# **Planning Phase**

## **Strategy**

### ***Site Aims***

These days, vaping has become a very popular and widespread replacement for traditional cigarettes; therefore, the possible product categories are vast. For some, it has proved a way to stop smoking; for others, it has become a hobby/lifestyle; in some places, it has even become a sport with organized cloud-chasing competitions to judge who can make immense vapor clouds.

This site aims to act as a fictional vape supply store's online presence and provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for customers to browse and purchase products.

For this project, I will only focus on the few categories widely considered to be the core products in the vaping scene, and any customer would expect to find in a store of this type. The exception to this would be sites that specialize solely in the production of e-liquid (e.g. [flavor art](https://flavourart.com/)) or vaping devices (e.g. [SmokStore](https://www.smokstore.com/)). The shop needs various products expected to assist people with their vaping needs. The admin panel will be leveraged with a user manual for the shop staff, who will manage the site sales during quieter periods.

The minimum must-have product categories for shops in the genre are: -

* Disposable vapes.
* E-liquids.
* DIY liquids section.
* MODS with Variable wattage/voltage and/or temperature control.
* Tanks and coils.
* Batteries.
* Chargers.

### ***Opportunities***

In the course of providing a fully functioning E-commerce platform, the following opportunities are available: -

---------------------- | --- | ---  
Totals | 133 | 138

### ***Scope***

Due to the time given for this project and the required grade criteria, There will need to be further trade-offs in the design/development process. Using the agile methodology, I will review my progress weekly and add, adapt, or remove features as applicable to the project at the review portion after each sprint to ensure an MVP is delivered by the deadline.

To avoid scope creep, I have used the MoSCoW method to divide the above opportunities into the below categories aiding me to prioritize and ensure that I can achieve my goal of a fully functioning MVP by the deadline: -

* To create a minimum functional E-commerce site, UX efforts **must** address these opportunities: -
  * Full CRUD Functionality.
  * User login/register.
  * Checkout system.
  * Account profile.
  * Mailing list.
  * Product Filters/searching.
  * Stripe payments.
  * SEO language throughout.
  * Guest checkout completion.
  * User Role permissions.
  * Order History.
  * Social Media page.
  * Special offers.
  * Password Recovery.
  * Email confirmation of order.
  * User feedback for actions taken.
  * Saved customer details on checkout.

* To enhance the customer experience and increase the sites functionality, UX efforts **should** address these opportunities: -
  * Age verification on the first visit.
  * Product reviews.
  * Stock management system.
  * Contact form.
  * Admin can add/remove products via the front end.
  * Delivery information.
  * Terms and conditions.
  * Order Status.

* To increase the sites popularity and customer base, UX efforts **could** address these opportunities: -
  * Vape Blog.
  * Video demo of products.
  * Related products
  * Ability to edit order until status set to processing.

* As they are so far out of the scope of this project, UX efforts **will not** address these opportunities: -

  * Trustpilot reviews.
  * Multiple currencies.
  * Generate sales reports.

### ***Structure***

Using the above as a guide, I have created a flow diagram to help me visualize how the user will navigate through the core functionality of the web store. During the Agile process, minor tweaks may occur to this pre-planned user journey, but the overall structure will remain the same.

![UserFlow Journey flowchart](docs/flowcharts/userjourney.jpg)

#### **User Stories:**

To assist the AGILE process, I have created several user stories to help me plan and implement the project. These will help me prioritize the features and functionality of the site and ensure that I am delivering an MVP by the deadline. The below user stories are divided into EPICs and will be reviewed and updated after each sprint.

##### **EPIC 1 - Set up and Deployment:**

This epic will be tasks rather than user stories since they will be aimed at me as the developer rather than the user. The below tasks will be completed before the first sprint and will be used to set up the project and ensure that it is deployed to Heroku with the AWS S3 bucket for static files. Some of these were taken/adapted from the Code Institute's sample project, Boutique ado.

* As a **Developer** I can...
  * ...**Create a Git hub repository** so that I can **Store my project files online.**
  * ...**Create a virtual environment on my local machine** so that I can **avoid polluting my machine on a global level.**
  * ...**Install Django and required libraries** so that I can **work with a postgress Database and cloudbased images from my local development IDE.**
  * ...**Set up my local coding environment** so that I can **develop on my local machine and deploy securely without revealing sensitive information.**
  * ...**Create a Heroku app** so that I can **link to the a virtually hosted Postgres database for the deployed site.**
  * ...**Create a new AWS S3 bucket** so that I can **store static files and images securely.**

The only user story in this Epic is related to the initial deployment; this is a user story rather than a task because it directly offers value to the user as opposed to being tasks required to create the project: -

* As a **User**, I can **access a live url** so that I can **use the site on any device**.

### **Skeleton**

#### **Wireframes:**

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq wireframes to visualize how the site would look and function. Included below are the wireframes used to plan the site's layout. However, some changes/omissions were made during the development process due to time or practicality.

##### ***Home Page:***

[Home page wireframe](docs/wireframes/landing-page.png)

##### ***Products Page:***

[Products page wireframe](docs/wireframes/products-page.png)

##### ***Product Details Page:***

This page changed from the original design in the following ways:

* Multiple images were not implemented and so no accordion was needed.
* Buy now button was removed as it was not needed.

These will now be added as part of the future features.

[Product details page wireframe](docs/wireframes/product-detail-page.png)

##### ***Shopping Cart Page:***

[Shopping cart page wireframe](docs/wireframes/shopping-cart-page.png)

##### ***Checkout Page:***

[Checkout page wireframe](docs/wireframes/checkout-page.png)

##### ***User Profile Page:***

This page changed from the original design in the following ways:

* No multiple addresses.
* No delete account button.
* No image/avatar upload.

These will now be added as part of the future features.

[User profile page wireframe](docs/wireframes/user-profile.png)

##### ***Order Confirmation Page:***

[Order confirmation page wireframe](docs/wireframes/order-confirmation-page.png)

#### **Database Schema:**

The database table scheme was created using [drawsql.app](https://drawsql.app) and can be seen below.

##### ***All Products Table***

This table was designed for scalability, I didn't have time to leverage the full advantages of a polymorphic data set, but I have included the fields that would be needed to do so. In the future, I would automate many more processes allowing for products with sizes to be linked together and display the product options on a single product page. This database model also allows for quicker queries as the volume of products grows, so it was designed now to save a lot of restructuring later when the business popularity grows.

##### ***Full ERD from PgAdmin***

The EDR from pgAdmin, connected directly to my instance of elephantSQL, shows the complete relationship of all tables. Including those which came from libraries such as all auth.

[Full ERD](docs/flowcharts/database/pgadmin-erd.png)

### **SEO considerations**

#### ***Keywords***

Unfortunately, the website word tracker never worked enough for me. I even subscribed and continued encountering the issue where I had no results or was told I had made too many searches. Speaking to their customer support, they advised this is a known issue and that they are working on it, but it's been a few months, and it's still not working for me. I have included a brain dump using keywords and google to return a list of long and short-tail keywords. The ones ticked were included in the site meta description.

![Key words Brain dump](docs/seo/keywords.JPG)

#### ***Page Titles***

Each page shows an extra title after the store name to assist help with SEO.

#### ***Robots.txt and sitemap.xml***

Sitemap and robots.txt files have been added to the site's root to help with SEO.

At first, I found that lighthouse was showing a fault with my robots.txt. The issue was that it was being read as an HTML file, not a text file. I fixed this by adding a URL path in the project level URLs.py. More about the method can be read [here](https://adamj.eu/tech/2020/02/10/robots-txt/).

Due to initializing the template in the path, I had to move the robots.txt into my templates folder to make it work.

### ***Content***

The site did not have many opportunities for content in terms of paragraphs and text. A lot of the keywords are products themselves, so I have tried to leverage the use of heading tags and other semantic tags correctly  so that the quality of my site's search rating is as high as possible.

### **Surface**

Once the project was planned I then had to decide on a theme. I wanted to keep it simple but have some color to help it stand out. I also wanted to keep it clean and easy to navigate. I have used a lot of white space and a simple color scheme to help with this.

#### ***Colour Scheme***

Black and white feature heavily throughout the site. However, I added color to help the content pop and to help with the branding. Below is the full-color grid I used to help me decide on the final color scheme. Some of my initial ideas changed due to contrasts, which are noted in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

The final color scheme can be seen below:
  
Online [here](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23007bff%2C%0D%0A%236c757d%2C%0D%0A%2328a745%2C%0D%0A%2317a2b8%2C%0D%0A%23ffc107%2C%0D%0A%23dc3545%2C%0D%0A%23f8f9fa%2C%0D%0A%23fff59a%2C%0D%0A%23343a40%2C%0D%0A%23ffffff%2C%0D%0A%235469d4%2C%0D%0A%23aab7c4%2C%0D%0A%23000000%2C%0D%0A%23004c9e%2C%0D%0A%23004c9e%0D%0A%23490049%0D%0A%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp)

And via GitHub [here](docs/color/contrast-grid.JPG)

#### ***Typography***

For this project, I have used the following fonts:

* [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans?query=dm+s) - This font is used for the main headings and the logo. It is a clean and simple font that is easy to read and stands out well.
* [Damion](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Damion?query=damion) - This was for the logo. I initially wanted to make the V and the T cursive; however, I found this font perfect for all letters of the logo.

## **Agile Development Process**

I used [JIRA](https://dnlbowers.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PVS/boards/5/roadmap) to track and create issues/user stories. When submitting the project, I will provide login credentials for the above project space. However, you can find a summary of my agile process/learnings [here](AGILE.md).

## **E-commerce Application Type**

As already mentioned, Vapor Town is a B2C e-commerce application. Selling directly to consumers means that the site is designed to sell quickly, on impulse, and in smaller quantities. While wholesale is a possible future goal, the website was not yet intended to sell to other businesses. For this reason, a large amount of the functionality is focused on the user experience and the ability to purchase products quickly and effectively

## **Marketing Stratergy**

As Vapor Town is a start-up business, the budget for marketing is limited. However, there are several ways that Vapor town can market itself to help increase sales and brand awareness. Using Facebook to pump out content and drive traffic is the first and most straightforward. The use of paid ads allows the business to target specific demographics and increase brand awareness. The use of social media is also a great way to get feedback from customers and to help with customer service. There is an image of the Facebook page in the features section below and a link to the page [here](https://www.facebook.com/people/Vapor-Town/100087760702549/).

The second is the use of google ads which are a great way to increase brand awareness and help with SEO. The use of google ads can also help with the use of long-tail keywords and help with the ranking of the site.

The third is the use of influencers. Influences are a great way to increase brand awareness. Free samples could be sent to popular vape reviewers on youtube in exchange for a mention/hashtag/ link in the description. Further helps raise brand awareness because the video could be posted on Facebook and the influencer tagged in the post, which with the help of the algorithm gods at Facebook, would help bring an organic audience to the Facebook page and, hopefully, the store.

The final method would then be sending regular news letters to the mailing list obtained via the mailchimp form.  The newsletter would contain links to recent articles on vaping, the latest products and the highly sought after special offers and promotions. This would help with brand awareness building a community around the brand.

# **Features**

## **Common to All Pages**

### **Navbar**

The navigation bar is the core navigation for the site. It differs slightly from mobile to desktop; however, both include all the same components.

#### **Overall Appearance**

##### ***Desktop***

![Desktop Navbar](docs/features/desktop/navbar-desktop.JPG)

##### ***Mobile***

![Mobile Navbar](docs/features/mobile/navbar-mobile.JPG)

#### **Common Navbar Features for both Desktop and Mobile**

##### ***Logo***

The logo was designed to symbolize the brand. I made it myself using HTML and CSS (including bootstrap classes). The logo is then scattered around the website to add color and help develop brand familiarity and recognition.

The size of the logo is responsive to the screen size. On mobile, it is smaller; on desktop, it is more prominent. Hence, it was important that the color scheme be vivid and the image relatable to the store's name.

###### ***Desktop***

![Desktop Logo](docs/features/desktop/logo-desktop.JPG)

###### ***Mobile***

![Mobile Logo](docs/features/mobile/logo-mobile.JPG)

##### ***Search Bar***

The search bar changes location according to the screen size, and this was to prevent squashing it on mobile. On desktop, it is in the center of the navbar, and on mobile, it is below the logo.

###### ***Desktop***

![Desktop Search Bar](docs/features/desktop/search-desktop.JPG)

###### ***Mobile***

![Mobile Search Bar](docs/features/mobile/search-mobile.JPG)

The user can enter their search term, and the products page will return any products that match the search term. This function checks the product name and description; the search term is retained and displayed to the user next to the number of results displayed.

![Search Bar](docs/features/search-term.JPG)

#### **Account menu**

The account menu is a drop-down menu that appears when the user clicks on the account icon. The drop-down changes slightly depending on the authentication status of the user. The menu will show the option to log in or register if the user is not logged in. If the user is logged in, the menu will allow them to log out and go to their account, where they can amend the default shipping address and review their order history.

##### ***Unauthenticated***

![Unauthenticated Account Menu](docs/features/unauthenticated.JPG)

##### ***Authenticated***

![Authenticated Account Menu](docs/features/authenticated.JPG)

#### **Cart icon**

The cart icon is visible in the navbar on all pages. The icon indicates the current total of all the items in the cart and how many things make up this total.

![Cart Icon](docs/features/cart-icon.JPG)

A cart preview appears when the user adds an item to the cart. This cart preview relays the success message, gives a scrollable preview of the cart, the current total excluding delivery, and an informative message about how far the user is from the free delivery qualifier.

![Cart Preview](docs/features/cart-preview.JPG)

And the cart icon turns blue, and a small pill appears with the product count.

![Cart Icon with pill](docs/features/cart-icon-pill.JPG)

Clicking the cart icon any time will take the user to the shopping cart page described later.

### **Footer**

#### ***Desktop***

![Desktop Footer](docs/features/desktop/footer-desktop.JPG)

#### ***Mobile***

![Mobile Footer](docs/features/mobile/footer-mobile.JPG)

#### **Common Features to both Desktop and Mobile**

The footer is a simple footer that is present on all pages. It contains three main sections, a disclaimer and a copyright section at the bottom.

The three sections typical to both desktop and mobile are:

* Social Media Links
* Newsletter Sign Up
* Sitemap

##### ***Social Media Links***

I have included only one social media link for Facebook for the purposes of this project as it is the one I would like most to leverage in my marketing strategy. However, should this project ever grow further, it would also be expected to include Twitter and Instagram as a minimum.

The current Facebook link will take the user directly to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/people/Vapor-Town/100087760702549/) where the shop will share promotions and news about the shop's ad internal vaping community regularly. More will be discussed about this in the marketing section.

I have included a screenshot of the Facebook page in case Facebook decides to remove it because it is not a real business at this stage.

![facebook page](docs/features/facebook.JPG)

##### ***Newsletter Sign Up***

I contemplated creating my newsletter system. However, I decided to use [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) as it is a free service that is easy to use and has a good reputation with excellent analytics, which are vital for a new business when trying to understand the effectiveness of their marketing.

##### ***Sitemap***

The site map in the footer serves two purposes:

  * It allows the user to navigate the site quickly and easily.
  * It helps to increase the SEO of the site.

### **Notifications**

Similar to the cart preview, the notifications are a small pop-up appearing on the screen's top right. They are used to inform the user of the status of their actions. For example, if the user adds an item to the cart, they will see a notification that says, "Item added to cart." If the user tries to add an item to the cart that is out of stock, they will see a notification that says, "Item out of stock." Where ever possible, when the cart preview is not required, the notifications do not include it. 

These alerts are color-coded according to the default bootstrap colors/names below:

![Bootstrap Colors](docs/features/toasts-colors.JPG)

** Kindly note that bg-secondary was not used for the toasts as it did not fit any specific purpose and alert type.
## **Page content**

### **Home Page**

The home page is the first page on which a user lands. For this reason, it has to have a clearly defined purpose and be easy to navigate. The page will also be used to promote the shop and its products.

To make the site's purpose immediately apparent, I included a hero image that was both colorful and eye-catching with a slogan relevant to the theme. I also had a call to action button that takes the user to the products page.

Below, I have included four cards highlighting four popular product groupings. These demonstrate the site's purpose further and encourage the user to explore the site further.

![Home Page](docs/features/home-page.JPG)

### **Products Page**

The products page is the main page of the site. It is where the user will go to browse the products and add them to the cart. It is also where users will go when they filter the products by category. 6 objects paginate the page at a time, and the user can navigate between pages using the pagination buttons at the bottom of the page.

Wherever the filter set the user chooses, they can sort by price, rating, and name.

On the individual product cards, the user can see the product name, price, rating, image, and, if relevant, a sale price. The user can also add the product to the cart from this page. Users can even add the product directly to their cart in the desired quantity without accessing the product details page. This intends to make the user experience as smooth as possible and reduce the number of clicks required to add an item to the cart.

The product names are all displayed in h2 tags and resized using CSS to increase the SEO of the site.

A user accesses the product details by clicking on the product image.

![Products Page](docs/features/products-page.JPG)

Further to the above, when a user searches for a product and no results are returned, a message is displayed informing them that no results were found.

![No Results](docs/features/no-products.JPG)

### **Product Details Page**

Users can access the product details page when they need more information before committing to purchase an item. This page contains all the information the user needs to make an informed decision. The page is divided into four sections:

* Breadcrumbs - A user can look at various other products in the same category or jump back to the home page.
* Product Image
* Name, Price, Rating, and select quantity
* Tabs for product description and reviews.

![Product Details Page](docs/features/desktop/details-desktop.JPG)

The layout does change a little on a mobile view to improve the appearance

![Product Details Page Mobile](docs/features/mobile/details-mobile.JPG)

It is also worth noting that a superuser can see an edit and delete button on the details page to quickly improve certain felids and remove the product altogether should it be required. I decided to leverage the admin panel for most internal business functions; however, I will go into more detail later.

![Product edit and delete for super users](docs/features/product-edit-del.JPG)

### **Reviews**

The reviews tab was best suited to be on the product details page, making it easy to determine for which product the review was intended. The reviews are displayed in an accordion to save space; however, this tab has a few different ways of displaying them depending on the user's verifications status.

#### ***Unauthenticated***

The user can see all reviews when logged out; however, they cannot leave one. Above the accordion, they are prompted to log in or register to leave a review. The prompt also appears when there are no reviews, along with an invite to be the first to review the product.

![Reviews when logged out](docs/features/reviews-logged-out.JPG)

#### ***Authenticated***

If a product has no review and the user is logged in, they will see an inline review form. This review must have at least a title and a rating, and several checks are in place to ensure the rating is between 1 and 5, and the title is not empty.

![inline review form](docs/features/reviews-inline.JPG)

If there is already an existing review for a product, then the user has a button to take them to the same form but on a new page. Once the user submits the review, they are returned to the product details page of the product they were reviewing.

![review form](docs/features/review-form.JPG)

The last thing to mention here is that the review author (and the superuser in case of foul language) can delete or edit the review. Editing/deletion is performed by clicking the delete/edit button in the review body, visible only to them.

![review edit and delete](docs/features/edit-review.JPG)

From a programmatic perspective, the review calculation is amended each time a rating is added, edited, or deleted so that the overall rating is always accurate.

### **Edit product - frontend form**

As shown above, the product details page has an edit button for the super user to make a quick edit should they spot a typo or want to change a picture. This button takes the superuser to a form pre-populated with the current product information. The user can then make the changes they require and submit the form. The form is validated on the front and back end, and the user is informed of any errors. The user is then redirected to the product details page.

![Edit product form](docs/features/edit-product.JPG)

### **Shopping Cart**

The shopping cart page is where the user can review the items for purchase, and there is a link that will skip the list of items and take the user directly to the totals at the bottom. The intention here is that if the user has a long list of items, they can quickly get to the checkout.

The user can also amend the quantity of each update and click the update button to update the cart. The user can also remove an item from the cart by clicking the remove button. The user cannot add more of a product than is currently in stock.

Once the user is happy with the items in the cart, they can click the secure checkout button to proceed to the checkout page.

The layout on this page changes slightly on mobile to improve the responsive nature. The quantity selector goes under the item on smaller screens. 
#### ***Desktop***

![Shopping Cart](docs/features/desktop/cart-desktop.JPG)

#### ***Mobile***

![Shopping Cart](docs/features/mobile/cart-mobile.JPG)

Lastly, users will see the following message displayed if they try to access the shopping cart with no items.

![Shopping Cart](docs/features/empty-cart.JPG)

### **Checkout**

The checkout page is where the user will enter their payment details and shipping address. There is a chance to make one final review of the cart before proceeding to payment. The user can also go back to the cart to make any changes. If the user is logged in with details already saved to their profile from a previous order, then the form will be prefilled with this information.

The user can also save their details from the checkout page. However, this option is unchecked by default to prevent users from accidentally saving their details.

The card element is injected by the stripe API and uses a payment system that is fully PCI compliant. The same API also handles any errors using the allocated div to display them to the user. For a list of test card numbers, please see the [stripe documentation.](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).

When the form has been submitted, the pay now button converts into a spinner to show it is processing. Further to the spinner, there is a transparent overlay to prevent the user from clicking anything else and creating multiple orders.

The page is fully responsive, and the display order changes slightly from mobile to desktop.

#### ***Desktop***

![Shopping Cart](docs/features/desktop/checkout-desktop.JPG)

#### ***Mobile***

![Shopping Cart](docs/features/mobile/checkout-mobile.JPG)

Guests can also check out, and on the checkout page, they see the following in place of the save info checkbox.

![Shopping Cart](docs/features/guest-checkout.JPG)

If users are not logged in, there is no way to return to the checkout success page, as described below

The last stage of the check out if for the user to receive an email like the sample below:

![Shopping Cart](docs/features/confirmation-email.JPG)

### **Checkout Success**

This page confirms to the user all the details of their order. At the bottom, the user can return to the home page or view the recent offers available.

This page can only be viewed once and has logic on the back end to prevent anyone from returning to it to protect the user's details from anyone who might be able to intercept the order number or be trying random UUIDs with the URL. For this reason, I have included a small disclaimer in red warning the user that if they were not logged in, they need to be careful not to leave or refresh the page and the only way to get the order info is by contacting the store directly.

![Checkout Success](docs/features/checkout-success.JPG)

### **Profile**

The profile page has a tab which is a form for the user to update their default shipping details

![Profile](docs/features/profile.JPG)

And another tab to view the order history in a scrollable table

![Completed orders](docs/features/completed-orders.JPG)

The order number is truncated to save space, and when the user clicks on it, they are taken to a variation of the checkout success page. The only differences to the original checkout success page are the lack of a warning not to leave the page if not logged in and the button at the bottom, which takes the user back to the profile page.

![return to profile](docs/features/profile-return.JPG)

### ***Contact us***

Finally, for the front end, I have created a simple contact form for the user to get in touch. I will discuss in detail shortly how this works from the point of view of replying. However, the form allows a platform for the user to send a message to the shop. The message will then be picked up from the admin panel and responded to via email, as is a standard convention.

![Contact us](docs/features/contact-us.JPG)

### **Authentication**

The user can log in and out using an adapted version of templates from the all-auth library.

![Login](docs/features/allauth/login.JPG) ![Sign out](docs/features/allauth/logout.JPG)

The user can reset their password via a form

![Reset password step 1](docs/features/allauth/pass-reset.JPG)

![Reset password - email sent](docs/features/allauth/pass-reset-2.JPG)

Then receive an email with a link to reset their password on the store site.

![reset email](docs/features/allauth/pass-reset-email.JPG)  

![change password form](docs/features/allauth/change-password.JPG)

Once changed, they will see the following message.

![password changed](docs/features/allauth/pass-reset-conf.JPG)

The user can also register for an account using the following form.

![Register](docs/features/allauth/register.JPG)

And will receive an email to verify their email, preventing spam accounts from being created.

![Verify email](docs/features/allauth/verify-email.JPG)

![Verify email](docs/features/allauth/email-verify.JPG)

The link in the email brings them to this screen

![Verify email](docs/features/allauth/conf-email.JPG)

And once the email is confirmed, the user is invited to log in with their new account.

### ***Stock management system***

I have built a simple stock system which means when an order is completed, the stock reduces by the quantity ordered. If the user tries to add more of an item to the cart than is in stock, they will see the following message.

![not enough stock](docs/features/not-enough-error.JPG)

Once an item is out of stock, the add to cart button is disabled, and future users are shown that the item is out of stock.

![out of stock](docs/features/in-out-stock.JPG)

The stock level is also affected by amending the order from the admin panel, which I will discuss shortly.

### **Age verification pop-up**

These files were found [online with an open license making it free to use and customize](https://www.jqueryscript.net/other/Website-Age-Verification-Plugin-with-jQuery.html#google_vignette). However, I couldn't make a vape store and not include it so for the sake of time I implemented and amended it to suit my needs.

![Age verification](docs/features/age-check.JPG) ![Age verification - deny](docs/features/age-deny.JPG)


### **Responsive Design**

It is worth stating that all pages are fully responsive; however, I have only screenshot the ones with a significant layout change in the screenshots above.

## **Admin Panel for Shop Administration**

I have decided that since Django has such a powerful admin panel built in, I would leverage this to help the daily running of the e-store.

### **Admin Panel Overview**

The admin panel is accessed via the /admin/ URL and is protected by a login. I have added a few extra features to help run the store.

#### ***Products***

The superuser can view all the products, categories, reviews, and orders from the admin panel. They can also add, edit and delete any of these items.

Staff can also filter and search for products and apply sales on mass. Depending on whether the sales field is checked, the price is taken from the rrp or the discount price. The user can use the reduce by percentages to quickly set up 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50% off mass sales. The reduce by percentage actions do not change the has sale field to “True,” so once the discounted price is set, they need to reselect the products and click “start sale” to apply the sale. This feature allows the store to set up mass promotions ahead of time and then click start sale when the promotion is ready to go live. Equally, the remove sale function then unchecks the has sale field to end the sale and everything returns to the rrp price.

They can also edit individual items by updating the discounted price or checking the has sale box from within the product.

**Note for the assessor** - All the sub-classes of the AllProducts model are hidden to keep the admin navigation simple for the user. They are all accessible via the AllProducts model, and each product type can be filtered by category or subcategory. This filter is partly why I introduced the subcategory model.

#### **Messages**

The admin panel is also where the superuser can see any messages sent via the “contact us” form, and there is a section for them to leave notes internally for other staff members to see. In the future, I would have a ticketing system so the admin could reply here too, and make it visible to the customer on the front end. Still, the customer leaves a message, and the admin can leave notes about actions needing to be done or the response they sent by email.

I have also enabled it so a staff member can mark a message as replied to, and it defaults as a pending reply; this is to help the staff members keep track of which messages have been replied to and which have not. To further help, a series of filter options allow the staff to filter by status and date.

#### **Orders**

The admin panel is also where the superuser can see any orders placed by customers, and there is a section for them to leave notes internally for other staff members to see.

There is a status field with multiple options so that the admin can keep track of the order status. The default is received (meaning by the store), and the admin can change this to processing (while packing and waiting to ship) or dispatched (when shipped). Several options refer to orders amended at the customer's request after completing the checkout process. These allow the staff to provide a dynamic service by documenting everything which changes by their hands. The admins can also filter by status so they can see which orders are awaiting extra payment for adding items or refunds for those that have been cancelled or had items removed.

The admin can also filter by date and shipping method. Shipping method was included as in the future; I would like to add an option to send by recorded mail or courier, which would allow the admin to filter by the shipping method to see which orders are being shipped by which way.

You may note that there is no ability to delete mass records in the order category, which is intentional. I have decided that this feature would lead to the potential of deleting orders wrongfully and users not receiving goods for which they have paid. Orders can still be deleted, but only one at a time, and the admin is prompted to confirm the deletion.

There is also the ability to amend line item quantities and delete line items, allowing the admin to amend orders after completing the checkout process. This is useful if the customer has requested an extra item or a partial refund. The admin can also add a note to the order to explain the reason for the change.  Also, I have left the original cart visible, showing a key pair value of {product_id: quantity} so that the admin can see the original order and how it has changed. Any amendment to the order also reflects in the stock level of the items in the store. I have also added a check to prevent an admin from adding more than is in stock to the order however, this is not a foolproof system, so the admin should be careful to check the stock level before adding items to the order. If the admin adds a quantity higher than the stock via the line items section and hits save, they will see a success message because the form was saved successfully. However, when you go back into the order, you will see that the quantity has not been saved and returned to its original value. I could not find a way to get a model method to return a message in the admin panel, so I left this feature like this for now. Since it is not a customer-facing bug, it is sufficient that staff using the system are made aware they must always be mindful of the current stock level when adding additional items to an order.

### **Future Features**

This project was a lot of fun, and although there is a viable MVP, there are many additional features I would like to add in the future.

#### ***Automation of the stock system***

Currently, purchase orders require someone to input them one item at a time manually. I want to add a feature to upload an exported excel file from the supplier and have the system automatically add the items to the stock.

#### ***Dynamically add nav links for new categories/subcategories***

Adding any categories or subcategories becomes a job for a developer with the current setup to add a new link to the front end manually. I want to have it so that the admin can extend (within reason) the navigation by creating a new category or subcategory in the admin panel.

#### ***Sales reports***

We all know that sales reports are necessary in this world of data-driven decision-making. I want to add a feature to the admin panel that allows the admin to generate sales reports for a given period. Accounts would enable the admin to see the store's performance and make decisions based on the data.

#### ***Additional shipping choices***

Such as couriers and recorded mail.

#### ***Additional payment methods***

Such as Paypal.

#### ***Additional user account features***

Additional user information, such as an extra address, phone number, etc., and an avatar to be displayed when leaving reviews to build a sense of community.

#### ***Product options***

Such as more images per item, and video demos, including linked products and related products. For example, as it is now, there would need to be a product for a 10 ml bottle and a 50 ml bottle. I want to have it so that the admin can add a product option for size and then have the opportunity to select the size from a drop-down menu when adding to the cart. This would allow the admin to have one product for both sizes, and the customer could select the size they want. Ideally, this feature would have a field that enables a product to know when another identical product exists and automatically link it to one product page with a drop-down

#### ***Ticketing Sytem***

Users can have a personal inbox when contacting the store regarding their issues.

## **Testing Phase**

I have included testing details during and post-development in a separate document called [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

## **Deployment**

The final Deployed site can be found [here](https://pp5-vaportown.herokuapp.com/)
I have included details of my initial deployment in a separate document called [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

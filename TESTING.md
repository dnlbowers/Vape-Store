# **Manuel Testing**

## **Bugs and Fixes During the Development Process**

Below is a list of bugs and fixes found while creating a feature. You can find other bugs as bug tickets in [JIRA](https://dnlbowers.atlassian.net/browse/PVS-47?filter=-2&jql=project%20%3D%20PVS%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20Bug%20AND%20reporter%20in%20(currentUser())%20order%20by%20created%20DESC). The Jira tickets are bugs found after I concluded the sprint including this feature because during the feature creation I missed the bugs.

* Issue - When installing dj_database_url via pip install command Django automatically upgraded to version 4.1.1
* Cause - Only had Django 3.2 installed. The latest version of this library requires installing a higher version of Django 3.2.
* Solution - Installed the latest version of Django 3.2 with pip install django==3.2.14 to ensure I am developing with the LTS version of Django.

* Issue - When trying to paginate my products view, the page displayed the products on the same page instead of being paginated.
* Cause - The first issue was the model's lack of ordering. The second issue was using the wrong function in my class view to retrieve the context data.
* Solution - First, I added an order to the AllProducts model to order the record by ID. Second I replaced the get_context_data function with get_context_object_name. This function then took the model fed into the class view and returned the context name as products.

* Issue - When trying to use AllProducts in the ProductDetails view, I got an error saying that this model had no object attribute. The odd thing was that in the shell, I could use a for loop to iterate through the model and its child models.
* Cause - There seems to be a known issue where the base model doesn't work when iterating via the views using the Django-polymorphic library.
* Solution - The solution for this was a workaround. I collected all the child models into an array and then iterated through the array in the view to find the correct ID passed in the URL. The downside of this is when scaling the site up later, it created an extra manual process to add the child models to the array if adding any new subtypes of products.

* Issue - when a search query returns only one item, the product card is thinner than normal
* Cause - I am not sure why this is happening. It has to do with rendering the product card using the bootstrap class.
* Solution - Adding a min-width to the card class resolved the issue.

* Issue - There are two unsynced qty selectors on the cart page, meaning that if the screen changes size, the second qty selector will not reflect the initial one
* Cause - There is no link between the two qty selectors on the cart page.
* Solution - Adding a variable to the increase/decrease click event to group all qty inputs for the same product together

* Issue – The app was not submitting the payment form (clearing the filled-in information), and an error was present saying the payment could not be processed even though Stripe was registering the payment as successful
* Cause - I could see in the browser console that the payment intent was successful, but a second request to the server was failing. The stripe logs showed the payment intent as successful, and this second attempt prevented the form submission from completing. From logging the relevant part of the code to the browser console, I could see that using the query submit() was submitting the form despite having the preventDefault() function in place.
* Solution - Changing the query submit() to vanilla JS using "addEventListener" for "submit" resolved the issue. Although I later found this was causing further problems with the form submission when testing the loading indicator via a 3ds test payment. I then decided to use a click event and discovered that combining JS and jquery in a single line wasn't working as it should, so I decided to write only Jquery regarding the button and the click() function.

Instead of documenting here from here out, I decided it was better to solely raise a bug ticket in [JIRA](https://dnlbowers.atlassian.net/browse/PVS-47?filter=10005). I was getting fixated on bugs preventing me from completing the sprint's overall purpose in a timely manner. I decided to raise the bugs and move on to the next feature, only to return in the same iteration later if there was spare time.

## **Testing(post development phase)**

### **Validation**

#### **[HTML](https://validator.w3.org)**

The only errors left were injected from the summernote widget used in the admin panel. I am using summernote in the product description field so that when adding products, the admin can style the text should they wish to. The errors were like the below and related to using inline CSS, which is no longer considered good practice.

![summernote css injection errors](docs/validation/html/summernote-css-injection.JPG)

Once I filtered the errors away, the rest of the site had no errors.

#### **[CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**

No errors were found within my CSS by checking each CSS file by direct input.

![CSS validation](docs/validation/css/css-validation.jpg)

#### **[JavaScript](https://jshint.com/)**

Checking my static JS files with jshint, it picked up one undeclared variable, stripe-elements.js.

![jshint](docs/validation/js/stripe-elements.jpg)

The above error was a false positive since this variable Stripe is the initialization of the stripe elements widget. Since this initializes a third-party API, I cannot change the variable name.

There was another set of warnings in mailChimp.js due to the use of the mail chimp API. I tried removing it entirely, but this caused other features to break on the site, so I put it back as it was. The warnings in jshint are not critical, so the file can be left as is.

![jshint](docs/validation/js/mailchimp.jpg)

#### **Python - PEP8 - using pycodestyle**

Due to pep8online.com still not being online, I used pycodestyle to check my python code. pycodestyle is a command line installed with pip. I ran the command "pycodestyle --first <-appname->" which I adapted from the suggestion in the [documentation](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#features). This command checks all files in the directories and subdirectories of the app and returns the first error found. With this and cross-checking in the terminal of VScode, I found the only errors were some lines being too long(E501). Mostly these were in the migrations directory of each app. However, it is outside this project's scope to fix the migrations files autogenerated by the "python manage.py makemigrations" command.

Besides the lines in the migration files, there were four lines in my settings.py file with the same E501 error. They can be found under the constant declaration "AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS" on line 171. As mentioned in my last portfolio project, this is a long-standing issue with using the pep8 checker with Django, and there have been some [suggested resolutions](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28163). However, Django seems to think shortening these lines is ill advisable. For this reason, I left them to be longer than 80 characters.

### **Wave Aim Accessibility checker**

To check the accessibility of my site, I used the [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) accessibility checker. This free tool checks for accessibility issues on a web page. It checks for contrast, alt text, and keyboard navigation issues. There were a few worthy documents listed below.

#### ***Within the Footer***

Consistently throughout the site, the footer was flagged for having one low contrast error and one error.  

![footer contrast errors](docs/validation/accessibility/footer.jpg)

These are related to the imported code from Mailchimp. The label-related error is for a hidden element; Mailchimp has included comments with this element advising mere mortals like me against messing with this code. The hidden part offers protection from bot sign-ups and is critical for security reasons. Since the component is hidden, I will play it safe and leave it as is.

![MailChimp hidden label error](docs/validation/accessibility/mailchimp-label-error.jpg)

The contrast error comes from the "sr-only" span under the Facebook link. Sr-only is a class I have used to hide the text from the user but still have it read by screen readers, which is a common practice and recommended by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/#hiding-label-text), and so should be left as is. Further thinking about it could also be why Mailchimp has included the hidden label element to ensure that screen readers read the text. However, I am just speculating.

![sr-only span error](docs/validation/accessibility/sr-only-error.jpg)

The above occurred again for the success toast shown on the checkout success page.

![success toast error](docs/validation/accessibility/sr-only-error-toast.JPG)

I also found that using white text on the toasts produced a low contrast score and so I changed the text to black. This change fixed the contrast error.

### **Automated tests**

I began writing automated tests for everything; however, I soon realized this was slowing me down, and I needed to focus on completing the project. You will find automated test files in the home and product apps. However, the remaining apps do not have automated tests. I have decided to write manual tests for the remaining apps and features by testing each user story individually.
